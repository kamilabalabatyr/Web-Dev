        <p class="story">I have recently started learning web development, and this blog is a place where I document my journey.
At first, everything felt confusing — HTML, CSS, tags, and strange symbols everywhere. But step by step, things started to make sense.<br><br>
I learned that <strong>HTML</strong> is used to structure a web page. It helps the browser understand what is a heading, what is a paragraph, and what is a link.<br><br>
This was my very first experience creating a real web page using only code, and it felt exciting.
Learning something new can be challenging, but it is also very motivating. Every small progress makes me want to learn more.</p>
        
        <h2 id="second">Understanding HTML & CSS</h2>
        <h6>Posted on January 2026</h6>
        <p class="story">After understanding the basics of HTML, I moved on to CSS, which is responsible for how a website looks.
CSS allows us to change colors, fonts, spacing, and layout of a web page.<br><br>
I learned how to style text using different font families, font sizes, and font styles.<br>
I also discovered how <strong>div</strong> and <strong>span</strong> elements help organize content and apply styles more easily.<br><br>
<em id="ell">Now I understand that HTML and CSS work together:</em>
<ul>
    <li>HTML creates the structure</li>
    <li>CSS makes it visually appealing</li>
</ul>
<p id="last">This knowledge is the foundation of front-end web development, and I am excited to continue learning more advanced topics in the future.</p>
