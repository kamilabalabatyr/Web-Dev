    <!-- 1st challenge: to write a poem -->
    <h1>A Line-storm Song</h1>
    
    <p>The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift,<br> 
  The road is forlorn all day,<br>
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,<br> 
  And the hoof-prints vanish away.<br> 
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,<br>
  Expend their bloom in vain. <br>
Come over the hills and far with me, <br>
  And be my love in the rain.<br> ... </p>

      <!-- 2nd challenge: to highlight -->
      <p>
        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are <em>born to lear</em>n.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <em>You can learn anything.</em>
        </p>
